# Maple
Maple is a behaviour tree designer and visualiser for Unity 2021.1+. It was originally designed near the beginning of my second year of study at Academy of Interactive Entertainment but has undergone multiple iterations. This being its last. *(maybe...)*</br>
</br>
The foundations for creating behaviour trees in code is near completion. Howvever, the UI bundled with the package is unfortunately not production ready and needs revision before it can be properly utilised.</br>
</br>
*Updates coming soon...*
